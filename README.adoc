== Snort 3.0 Demo

This test suite contains examples of Snort 3.0 usage. Each directory
contains all the files sufficient to demonstrate a use case and a 
README that explains the interesting bits.

Demos are executed using bats, a simple bash test framework, which
you can find here: https://github.com/bats-core/bats-core.

To execute the tests:

./run_test.sh <snort3_installed_path>

run_test.sh will find *.bats files recursively from the current
directory down and execute each test. Output is in TAPS format with
a summary at the end.
