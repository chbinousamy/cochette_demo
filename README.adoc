== Snort 3.0 Demo

This test suite contains examples of Snort 3.0 usage. Each directory
contains all the files sufficient to demonstrate a use case and a 
README that explains the interesting bits.

Demos are executed using bats, a simple bash test framework, which
you can find here: https://github.com/bats-core/bats-core.

To execute the tests:

./run_test.sh <snort3_installed_path>

run_test.sh will find *.bats files recursively from the current
directory down and execute each test. Output is in TAPS format with
a summary at the end.

You can also execute a single test by specifying the relative path to
the specific test.bats file, e.g.:

./run_test.sh <snort3_installed_path> tests/ips_actions/replace_rewrite/test.bats

Do this first if you require --daq-dir to run Snort 3:

export SNORT3_DAQ_DIR="<daq3_installed_path>"
