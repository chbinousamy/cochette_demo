=== IPS react action test

This is a test of the "react" IPS action. It "react"s to an http GET request
by responding with a configured http page.
React is using payload_injector utility. When using react rules it should be
configured as well.
Normalizer is configured to ensure normalizer.tcp.ips = true (it is the default
when normalizer is configured). It ensures the rule is triggered when receiving
the GET packet itself instead of waiting for the server ack before processing it.

Test result verifies:

1. compare the alert -- drop verdict

2. compare the inline-out.pcap -- reset of connection and the http
   request was rejected by configured http page contents. The remainder
   of the flow was blacklisted.
