=== IPS react action test

This is a test of the "react" IPS action. It "react"s to an http GET request
by responding with a configured http page.

Test result verifies:

1. compare the alert -- drop verdict

2. compare the inline-out.pcap -- reset of connection and the http
   request was rejected by configured http page contents. The remainder
   of the flow was blacklisted.
