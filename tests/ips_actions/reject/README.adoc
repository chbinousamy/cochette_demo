=== IPS reject action test

This is a test of the "reject" IPS action. It resets a connection on a http
GET request.

Test result verifies:

1. compare the alert -- reset verdict
In the expected file you can see the alert generated which has a verdict of 'reset'

04/02-16:10:01.383009, 6, TCP, stream_tcp, 369, C2S, 10.3.2.1:48620, 10.9.8.7:80, 1:1:0, reset

2. compare the inline-out.pcap -- reset of connections.

To confirm the reset of the connections you can view the inline-out.pcap that is generated in tcpdump format. Inside the 
pcap you will see the reset packets.

12:10:01.383087 IP 10.3.2.1.48620 > 10.9.8.7.http: Flags [R.], seq 415, ack 321, win 0, length 0
12:10:01.383087 IP 10.9.8.7.http > 10.3.2.1.48620: Flags [R.], seq 1, ack 415, win 0, length 0

In this configuration example both connections are set to be reset and send icmp unreachables.

reject = { reset = "both", control = "all" }

The icmp unreachables can also be seen within the inline-out.pcap file:

12:10:01.383087 IP 10.3.2.1 > 10.9.8.7: ICMP host 10.3.2.1 unreachable - admin prohibited filter, length 36
12:10:01.383087 IP 10.3.2.1 > 10.9.8.7: ICMP net 10.3.2.1 unreachable, length 36
12:10:01.383087 IP 10.3.2.1 > 10.9.8.7: ICMP host 10.3.2.1 unreachable, length 36
12:10:01.383087 IP 10.3.2.1 > 10.9.8.7: ICMP 10.3.2.1 tcp port 48620 unreachable, length 36

In order to get the inline-out.pcap file you will need to use the daq 'dump' option and enable inline operation (-Q)

-Q --daq dump

So you will start snort something like this to read a pcap and produce the inline-out.pcap:

./bin/snort -c etc/snort/somefile.lua -Q --daq dump --daq-var load-mode=read-file -r etc/snort/somepcap.pcap -Acsv -k none -q
