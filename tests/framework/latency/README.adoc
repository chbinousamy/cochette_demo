=== Latency

This test is to demonstrate packet latency behavior when fastpath is enabled.

Test verifies:

1. This test verifies the packet processing path for traffic that reaches the max latency setting with fastpath enabled. 
For this test the packet latency max timer is set to one second. 

When using the following config:

latency =
{
    packet =
    {
        max_time = 1,
        fastpath = true
    }
}

An event is generated each time the max_time threshold (the time the packet is held for processing) is exceeded. The packet is fastpathed and neither of the configured rules below fire.
 
The events for GID 134 are generated instead. This results in the traffic bypassing any remaining rules.

local_rules =
[[
alert icmp (
    msg:"Ping"; sid:1;
    content:"1234567"; content:"1234"; content:"56",distance 0,within 2; content:"7",distance 0,within 1;
    pcre:"/1.+7/smi"; itype:8;
    )

alert icmp (
    msg:"Pong"; sid:2;
    content:"1234567"; content:"1234"; content:"56",distance 0,within 2; content:"7",distance 0,within 1;
    pcre:"/1.+7/smi"; itype:0;
    )
]]

If we remove the packet configuration under the latncy module then we will get events for both local rules since the packet isnt fastpathed and normal inspection happens.
