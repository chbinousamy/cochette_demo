=== Rate Filter

Rate filter provides rate based attack prevention by allowing users to
configure a new action to take for a specified time when a given rate is
exceeded.

The test is using rate filter to limit total sessions by destination.
The rate_filter rule defined allows a maximum of 30 successful
simultaneous connections to any one IP address, and alerts on any further
connections attempts to that IP address for 1 second.
seconds is the time period over which count is accrued. 0 seconds means count
is a total count instead of a specific rate. new_action replaces rule action
for timeout seconds, in this case 1.
The pcap contains 100 connections each with a 10-second duration at a rate
of 10 connections per second. All connections are between the same source
and destination.
The first 30 connections are allowed, then the rule is triggered. The rule
will continue to trigger on every connection attempt, as the number of active
connections remains more than 30.
