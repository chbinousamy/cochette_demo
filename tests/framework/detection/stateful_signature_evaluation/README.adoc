=== Detection - Stateful Signature Evaluation

   The test demonstrates how stateful evaluation could be used
   for matching the rule.

   Test verifies:

   1. byte_jump ips option generates a continuation for 1:1 rule.
   2. Generated continuation matches on relevant packet with respect to processed bytes
      and file context.

   Since the file structure is a well-known format, the rule could be written to
   check values at the exact position. The file header contains the offset needed to
   jump directly to IFD entry. The rule reads that field, calculates an offset in bytes and
   does a 'long' jump (over 300000 bytes) right to the entry, skipping intermediate data.
   The rule 1:1:0 checks if the image is 400 pixels wide.
