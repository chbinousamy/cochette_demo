=== Event Filter

This is to test the limit feature of event_filter.

Test verifies:

1. After every 10 seconds, an ICMP alert is generated. Without the filter in place an alert will be generated for each packet.
The event filter allows you to group and filter events based on several fields (i.e src, dst etc). Use 'snort --help-module event_filter' to see 
the available options.
