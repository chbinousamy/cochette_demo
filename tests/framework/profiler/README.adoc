=== Profiler

This test is to configure profiling of rules and/or modules.

Test verifies:

1. This tests profiler rule output can be limited to COUNT items.

profiler =
{
    rules = { count = 2, sort = 'checks' },
    modules = { show = false },
    memory = { show = false }
}

In the example above the module's time stats and memory stats are set to false. 
Set to true to see more rule profile information and stats.

rule profile (worst 2, sorted by checks)
#       gid   sid rev checks matches alerts time (us) avg/check avg/match avg/non-match timeouts su
=       ===   === === ====== ======= ====== ========= ========= ========= ============= ======== ==
1         1     2   0      2       2      2        17         8         8             0        0   
2         1     4   0      2       0      0         4         2         0             2        0   

With the current settings it shows the worst performing rules sorted by the 'checks' field.

To view all available options use '/bin/snort --help-module profiler'.
