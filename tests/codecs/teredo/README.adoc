=== Teredo codec

Teredo provides IPv6 connectivity by encapsulating IPv6 datagram packets within
IPv4 UDP packets.

The pcap has TCPv6 traffic tunneled using Teredo over UDPv4.
The first test verifies traffic is decoded correctly. The rule is searching for 
content "teredo tunnel" in tcp packet.
In the second test the number of ip layers supported is limited to 1. Snort is 
hitting the limitation and stops decoding the traffic, triggering built-in rule 
116:293.
