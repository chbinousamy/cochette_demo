=== IP-in-IP and IPv4

This test is to verify the IP-in-IP and IPv4 codecs. The pcap consists of a single packet which is
the first piece of a fragmented IP packet. Snort decodes the outer IPv4 layer but does not decode
the inner IPv6 layer because the IPv4 layer is fragmented.

The IPS rule, which is defined to alert on an IP packet with a fragement offset of 0, triggers on
the packet.
