=== VLAN

This test verifies that Snort handles 802.1AD VLAN traffic.

The pcap consists of a QinQ frame, which contains two VLAN 802.1Q headers. The frame is an ICMP
echo reply packet, which triggers an IPS rule that contains the icode and itype rule options. These
match on an ICMP packet's code and type, respectively.
