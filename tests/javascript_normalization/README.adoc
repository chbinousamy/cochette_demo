=== JavaScript Normalization

The test demonstrates usage of JavaScript Normalization.

JavaScript Normalizer will remove all extraneous whitespace
and newlines, keeping a single space where syntactically necessary.
Comments will be removed, but contents of string literals will
be kept intact. Semicolons will be inserted, if not already present,
according to ECMAScript automatic semicolon insertion rules.
Identifier names, except those from the js_norm_ident_ignore list,
will be substituted with unified names in the following format:
var_0000 -> var_ffff. Identifiers from the list will be placed
as is, without substitution. Starting with the listed identifier,
any chain of dot accessors, brackets and function calls will be kept
intact.

The rules are written for the two HTTP responses.
SID 1 will be triggered on packet 6, which contains an HTML page
with inline JavaScript code wrapped in <script> tags.
SID 2 will be triggered on packet 16, which contains JavaScript code.
This packet has "Content-type: application/javascript" field, which
indicates that it's an external JavaScript package.
All contained JavaScript will be normalized and accessed using the
js_data buffer selector.

The test also shows trace messages related to JavaScript
Normalization.
"js_norm:proc" shows information about the script
normalization process.
"js_norm:dump:3: original" shows an original script
being processed.
"js_norm:dump:1: js_data" shows a result of JavaScript
Normalization.
