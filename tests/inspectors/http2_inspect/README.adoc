=== HTTP/2 Inspector

The HTTP/2 inspector converts HTTP/2 frames into HTTP/1.1 message sections and feeds them to the HTTP
inspector for further processing.
For headers frames this includes HPACK decoding, converting pseudo-headers into HTTP/1.1 start line,
and converting regular headers into HTTP/1.1 format.
HTTP rule options can be used on HTTP/2 traffic. If needed to alert on HTTP/2 traffic only,
service: http2; can be added to the rule (see sid:4).

The rules demonstrate using HTTP rule options on HTTP/2 traffic.
sids 1-3 are matching HTTP/2 headers frames. sid:4 is matching HTTP/2 data frame.
