=== Binder

This is to test the use of the binder.

Test verifies:

1. An inspection policy and IPS policy can be loaded via the binder. This test demonstrates how to load those 
policy configurations by using the binder.

{ when = { nets = "10.0.0.0/8" }, use = { ips_policy = "ips.lua" } 

and

{ when = { nets = "10.0.0.0/8" }, use = { inspection_policy = "inspection.lua" } } 


2. Events for a builtin rule 140:26 and a local SIP rule are generated.
