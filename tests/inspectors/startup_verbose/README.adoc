=== Verbose config output

As a part of verbose mode (-v command-line option)
inspectors print their configurations.

The Inspectors' verbose output shows:
 1. List of inspectors engaged in the run (from the main policy).
 2. List of inspectors from sub-policies.
 3. The final configuration for every inspector (default and user-configured).
 4. The values read from external resources, like 'hosts.txt' in this test.

The verbose output is gathered from all loaded configuration files,
and this allows the user to troubleshoot any inspector configuration issues.
Also, option names in the output stick to configuration option names
as much as possible. Along with the LUA-like syntax it all ease the fixing
of configurations.

This test ensures that for the given configuration Snort produces expected
Inspectors' verbose output, which is the summary of
snort.lua snort_defaults.lua and default configuration values.
