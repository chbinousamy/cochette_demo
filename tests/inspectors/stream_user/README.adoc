=== Stream User Inspector

The Snort stream_user module provides user session tracking and processing functions, which handles
packets produced from the DAQ socket and hext modules.

This test demonstrates use of the hext DAQ with the stream_user module.

The hext module generates packets suitable for processing by Snort from hex/plain text. Raw packets
include full headers and are processed normally. Otherwise the packets contain only payload and are
accompanied with flow information (4-tuple) suitable for processing by stream_user.

The input file for this test demonstrates the hext input format:

$packet 10.1.2.3 48620 -> 10.9.8.7 80

x47 45 54 20 2F 74 72 69 67 67 65 72 2F 31 20 48 54 54 50 2F  # GET /trigger/1 HTTP/
x31 2E 31 0D 0A 48 6F 73 74 3A 20 6C 6F 63 61 6C 68 6F 73 74  # 1.1..Host: localhost
x0D 0A 0D 0A                                                  # ....

The first line has the form '$packet <addr> <port> -> <addr> <port>'. A line starting with '$' is a
command, in this case to create a new packet from 10.1.2.3:48620 to 10.9.8.: 80. In a command where
$packet is followed by a 4-tuple, the packet direction is determined using the heuristic that the
client is the side with the greater port number. So in this example, the packet is being sent from
the client to the server.

$packet commands should be followed by packet data, which may contain any combination of hex and
strings. Data for a packet ends with the next command or a blank line. Data after a blank line will
start another packet with the same tuple as the prior one.

This packet data consists hex, signaled by the lines starting with the character 'x'. The '#'
character indicates a comment. The comments in this example packet tell us that the packet contains
an HTTP/1.1 GET request.

This packet triggers an alert on an IPS rule matching the string 'trigger' in the HTTP URI.

To generate hext-formatted input for Snort, the hext logger can be used with pcaps to dump full
packets in a way that can be read by the hext DAQ in raw mode. This can provide a quick (and dirty)
way to edit pcaps.
