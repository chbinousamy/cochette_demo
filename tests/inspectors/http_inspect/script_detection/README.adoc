=== HTTP Inspector - Script Detection

The test demonstrates usage of Script Detection.

HTTP inspector inspects the traffic for the following
sequence of characters: `</script>`. When observed, the 
implementation will take that to be the end of a script 
and will immediately flush that data segment through 
inspection and detection. Partial inspection allows any IPS
rules to match on any malicious behavior in that script.

In this test, malware is in packet 10 and end of script tag
in packet 18. When inspector sees end of script, partial
inspection is triggered and detects malware, eventually
blocking packet 18.
