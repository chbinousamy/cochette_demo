=== HTTP Inspector - Detection options

The test demonstrates usage of HTTP rule options.

The rules are written for the first pair of GET request and response.
The HTTP request contains GET /i/s2s/s2s_logo-blue.gif.
sid:1 is looking for method GET and "gif" in the URI.
sid:2 is using a mixture of different header field options.

The next rules are matching the response.
sid:3 and sid:4 are both looking for "Expires:". Since it appears only in the header, only sid 4 will trigger.
sid:5 is using a mixture of different header field options.
sid:6 and sid:7 are looking at the message body.
sid:6 finds a match for "GIF89aQ", sid:7 finds a match for "k!@".
