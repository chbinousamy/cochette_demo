=== RNA (Real-time Network Analysis) Inspector

This test is to verify that the RNA inspector runs correctly.

Test verifies:

1. Test IP-based discovery works as expected
2. Test network protocol, service protocol discovery work as expected


The test begins by loading the following modules:
stream            (required for operation of RNA)
stream_udp        (required for RNA to correctly obtain start of flow events for UDP traffic)
stream_icmp       (required for RNA to correctly obtain start of flow events for ICMP traffic)
host_cache        (required for RNA, and to specify the output host_cache dump file)
rna               (the RNA module)

In the configuration of the RNA module, we specify the following configurations:
-> Monitor the 8.8.0.0/16 subnet on any zone
-> Ignore the host 8.8.8.8 on any zone
-> Monitor the 10.10.10.0/16 subnet on any zone

Note that excluding 8.8.8.8 will take precedence over the rule to monitor the entire 8.8.0.0
subnet, so RNA excludes traffic for which 8.8.8.8 is the source IP

The pcap contains DNS traffic between 10.10.10.19 and servers 8.8.8.8 and 8.8.4.4.
RNA discovers 10.10.10.19 since it is the source address of the first three packets. For the
next three DNS packets, RNA discovers 8.8.8.4 as it is included by the first rule in rna.conf,
although it ignores 8.8.8.8 as it is excluded by the second rule.

The next four packets are ICMP traffic. For the first ICMP packet, RNA sees a source IP that
it has already seen within the default timeout value (3600 seconds), although this is a new
transport protocol than the previous time we saw 10.10.10.19, so we add ICMP to the list of
transport protocols. The next three ICMP packets have source IP addresses that RNA has not
seen previously, so they are added to the host cache with only one transport protocol (ICMP).

Because of the configuration of host_cache, it will dump its contents when snort is shutdown.
We use this host cache dump to verify correct operation of RNA, as it contains all IP hosts
discovered, in addition to their network and transport protocols, MAC addresses, and last seen
times.
