=== Stream File Inspector

The DAQ file module provides the ability to process files directly without having to extract them
from pcaps. Snort's stream_file module processes this file data and provides access to Snort's
normal file type identification and signature services as well as IPS detection and logging. This
module is primarily for development and testing.

This test demonstrates IPS detection with the DAQ file module and Snort stream_file. The config file
defines an IPS rule that will alert on a content match of the string "PDF-1.3" in a file processed
directly by Snort with the stream_file module.

The test runs Snort with the command line option '-s 8192', which sets the snap length to 8192
bytes. For the file module, this means that Snort will only read the first 8192 bytes of the file.
Thus the expected alert contains the 'packet' length of 8192 despite the file having length 24311. 
This length is sufficient for this test since the PDF version string we are matcing on comes at the
start of the file. If you wish to process the entire file using the DAQ file module, the snap length
must be set to at least the length of the file.
