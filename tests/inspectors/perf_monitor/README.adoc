=== Perf Monitor

This is to test that Perf Monitor correctly populates the DAQ stats.

Test verifies:

1. The Perf Monitor populates the DAQ statistics correctly when using the keyword '--daq-batch-size'. 

With the configuration options below:

perf_monitor = 
{
    output = 'file',
    format = 'text',
    packets = 1,
    seconds = 1,
    modules = { { name = 'daq' } }
}

The output file and its type (text) are specified as well as the packet count (1), timer (1) and module (daq).

See the snort manual for more details.
