=== IEC104 Inspector - PAF

This test demonstrates how IEC104 messages can be split apart or 
combined through use of the PAF functionality

The pcap has the following IEC104 messages:

* Three IEC104 Messages pipelined into one frame
   * Valid Unnumbered Control Function APCI message
   * Invalid Numbered Supervisory Function APCI message
   * Valid Information Transfer Format APCI message
* One IEC104 Message split across two frames
   * Invalid Information Transfer Format APCI message

In the first example, three IEC104 messages are pipelined into one
frame. The second message in the frame contains a reserved value
which triggers builtin alert 6. In the second example, one IEC104
message is split across two frames. This message contains an 
invalid number of elements, which triggers builtin alert 9.
