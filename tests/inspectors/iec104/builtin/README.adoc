=== IEC104 Inspector - Builtin Rules

This test demonstrates usage of the builtin service inspector rules

The pcap has the following IEC104 messages:

* Unnumbered Control Function APCI message with an invalid length field
* Information Transfer Format APCI message with an invalid number of items field

These messages can be detected through use of the rules within the
service inspector itself. Service inspector rules can be enabled
by setting the `enable_builtin_rules` Snort configuration option 
to `true`.
