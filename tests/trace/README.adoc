=== Trace logger framework

The Trace module provides a way to configure execution traces.
At crucial points of execution flow Snort has built-in trace messages.
Thus, the control thread and packet processing threads can inform us of
what's going on internally.

Availability of trace messages depends on build type and loaded modules.
So, the correct way to get a configuration is asking Snort about that:
'snort --help-module trace'.

The Trace configuration consists of three main parts:
 * output loggers
 * message configurations
 * packet message filtering

Snort has two built-in trace loggers available:
 * 'trace.output = "stdout"' prints messages to stdout stream.
 * 'trace.output = "syslog"' sends messages to SYSLOG.
For these loggers the 'trace.ntuple' option enables an extended format,
which includes n-tuple packet info (source IP address and port,
destination IP address and port, protocol ID, address space ID).

Every module in Snort can define its own traces and message types. If a module
supports trace, it will be presented in the `trace.modules` option
as a sub-table. By setting the appropriate verbosity level of each message type,
the user can configure Snort to print only desirable traces.

Since, many of trace messages are related to packet processing, additional
filtering can be done.
The user configures trace printing for specific packets only
by setting up constraints (protocol ID, IP addresses and ports).

This test shows a simple configuration to get some traces in stdout.
So, the Inspector Manager and Wizard will print their messages
about processing UDP packets.

The pcaps directory contains files representing three flows:
 * tcp.pcap will be processed, but no traces produced for it
   due to the constraints
 * udp_1.pcap will be processed, traces with extra info will be generated
 * udp_2.pcap will be processed, traces with extra info will be generated
