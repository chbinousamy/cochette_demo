=== SHA256 and SHA512

sha256 and sha512 (and md5) are content options that match on a hash of the buffer data.  These
options all work in a similar fashion:

1. The offset and relative options are used to find the start of data for the current buffer and
cursor position.

2. The buffer is checked to see if the specified length of data is available from the start.  

3. The buffer size is checked to ensure that the required length bytes are present from the start
position.

4.  The data is hashed according to the given algorithm.

5.  The result of the hash is compared against the specified digest.

Since the data must be hashed before comparison, these are relatively expensive rule options.
However, they may be needed in cases where the specific pattern to be matched should not be revealed.

This test is demonstrates the sha256 and sha512 options.  All rules match on (raw) packet 4:

The interesting bits for the rules are:

sid:3; content:"For"; sha256:<sha3>, length 7, relative, offset 2;
sid:5; content:"For"; sha512:<sha5>, length 7, relative, offset 2;

sid:4; content:"For"; sha256:<sha4>, length 9, offset 56;
sid:6; content:"For"; sha512:<sha6>, length 9, offset 56;

SIDs 3 and 5 are looking for the XFF address "1.1.1.1".  First they match the content at 0x53 and
then try to match the SHA for the 7 bytes starting at 0x58 (cursor + 2) which fails.  The rule
loops and searches for the content again landing at 0x5D.  This time the SHA for the 7 bytes at
0x62 is a match.

SIDs 4 and 6 are looking for ": 1.1.1.1".  In this case the SHA options are not relative so the
first attempt matches at 0x60, ie start of buffer + offset = 0x28 + 0x38.

One way to compute the SHAs is to echo like this:

sha3: echo -n "1.1.1.1" | sha256sum
sha5: echo -n "1.1.1.1" | sha512sum

sha5: echo -n ": 1.1.1.1" | sha256sum
sha6: echo -n ": 1.1.1.1" | sha512sum

Note the use of -n to avoid including a newline character.
