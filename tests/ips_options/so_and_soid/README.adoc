=== SO and SOID

This test demonstrates the use of SO rules.  Look at the bats file to see the
process.  Here is a summary:

1.  Write your so rule in text form.  Add function hooks at the point you want
    them called.  You may also invoke custom rule options.  You may use zero or
    more of either or both.

2.  Run snort to translate your text rule into a header file you can include in
    your so rule source file.

3.  Write your so rule source file.  You must define any eval functions and new
    rule options in your source file(s).  Your source file must define snort_plugins
    and implement certain API functions.  See the example for details.

4.  Run snort to dump your rule stub.  Your stub must be included in your
    configuration to activate your so rule.

5.  Run snort with your so rule stub and dynamic library.  Your stub must be
    included like a text rule.  Your dynamic library must be found in the
    --plugin-path.

3:13 looks for a Cheez Whiz attack by counting the number of cans feteched per
flow.  Anything over 7 triggers the alert.  If your tolerance is higher, you
can adjust the threshold in the rule.

Some things to note:

* FlowData is strictly optional.  Use for per flow state where flowbits won't work.

* All of <args> from so:<args>; in your rule will be passed in to your ctor.
  You use this string to identify the function name when you have multiple so
  options and to pass in any other args.  You could just hard code those args
  since they can't be changed via the stub.  If you want real arguments, create a
  new rule option.

* Cursor start is at the end of your last content match.  Use existing buffer
  selectors and content matches to position the cursor to keep your so logic
  simple.
