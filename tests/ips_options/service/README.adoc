=== Service

This test is to verify the functionality of service ips option.

Test verifies:

1. This test verifies the snort configuration using service ips option. Note that service is a
keyword, not part of metadata like with Snort 2.

2. Using service in the rule body will match on service or ports. sid:1 has dst port 12345 which is
not matched.

3. Using service in the header (protocol field) will match pn service and ports. sid:2 has src port
445 which is matched. If the service was in the body, it would fire on each direction.
