=== Snort2Lua

Snort 2 configuration files are written in Snort-specific syntax
while Snort 3 configuration files use Lua syntax. Snort2Lua is a program
specifically designed to convert valid Snort 2 configuration files
into Lua files that Snort 3 can understand. The Snort2Lua source code
is located in the tools/snort2lua directory.

The test provide an example of converting large Snort 2 configuration file
which contains almost all things that can be used for legacy
Snort configuration:

* different variable types
* decoder, detect engine and preprocessors configurations
* output plugins configuration
* different rule types and options
* various bindings

This test uses '-r' and '-t' snort2lua options to write included rules
and configured bindings to a separate output files. Thus, in addition
to the main configuration file (snort.lua), this test generates
4 additional files: one file for rules and 3 for vlan, network
and policy bindings. For more information about snort2lua options
run it with "-h" or "-?" option.

The converted lua files contain many comments that may be helpful
to users familiar with Snort 2 configurations. This can make the transition
to the new Lua syntax smoother and facilitate manual updating of config.
Below are few useful examples:

* option name change information
  ** example: `--option change: 'gen_id' --> 'gid'`

* removed and deprecated options information
  ** examples: `--option deleted: 'track_tcp'`,
     `# uricontent deprecated --> 'http_uri: content:'foo'`

* rule conversion information
  ** example: `# Rule type 'drop' discards the current packet only;`
     `using 'block' to discard all packets on flow`

The test also validates converted configuration in test mode with Snort 3
to make sure that the resulting configuration is fully applicable to it.
More info about Snort 3 configuration syntax and examples can be found
in Snort 3 User Manual.
